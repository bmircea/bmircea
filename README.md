<h2>Hello ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<br>
- Hi, Iâ€™m Mircea. I'm currently in my 2nd year studying CS at University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science.<br>
- I've been playing with everything related to tech since I was a child, and, at the moment, I can say that I'm truly pleased with everything I'm doing and learning. <br>
- In particular, I'm keen on the financial industry and the technology and infrastructure that are behind banking systems, exchanges, etc. Also, recently I've been getting 
  into DevOps and Distributed systems. <br>
- Feel free to browse through the projects that I've worked on during high school and uni! Some of them are more polished than others <br>
